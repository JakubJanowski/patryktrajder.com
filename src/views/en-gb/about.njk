          Hey! This is Patrick, I'm 23 and I'm a mechanic. I've been a garage air conditioner since I was a kid. I build things out of steel. I don't like schematic solutions. If something seems stupid and works, it's not stupid ðŸ˜‰ I run 3 main series: experiments, tool building and crazy inventions.

          I have always been interested in the world of machines, inventions and crazy things. While my colleagues from the estate were collecting money for chips, I was buying semi-finished products needed for pyrotechnic projects. I could never sit still and had a head full of crazy ideas, not always wise. Life in the block was too gray and boring for me. That's why when I moved from town to country at the age of 13, I felt the enormous possibilities opening up for me.

          The only limitation now is imagination and money. When it turned out that I had an old pigsty at my disposal, I knew immediately that I would not be breeding pigs there. I cleaned up the cluttered room and started to transform it into a makeshift workshop, where I try to carry out my strange projects, which you can see on my channel.
