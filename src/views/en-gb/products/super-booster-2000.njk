              I designed the whole idea of the construction already 5 years ago, since then I have been trying to make modifications all the time to make it the best. The latest version is improved by, among other things
              <br>
              hardened shaft (the same as used for cylinders in construction machines), a special tip for quick change of holesaws, a graduation angle for easy and quick setting of the device for the job, pins (so that the pressure of the material always holds in place), angle lock for repeat cuts, and several other improvements that significantly increase the comfort of work. However, they also increased the price ðŸ˜‰. My goal was to create a product with the best possible parameters and at an affordable price for everyone. At the beginning I assumed selling the set a bit cheaper, but I came to the conclusion that increasing the quality will be a good decision.

              As you can see, in the picture next to it, the place where you have to weld a "threaded pole" was pressed through a laser engraver with an accuracy of 1 hundredth of a millimetre, which, combined with a groove fit, guarantees pleasant work without surprises ðŸ˜‰.

              I designed the whole folding set in such a way as to make it easy to assemble, so that even a novice DIY enthusiast wouldn't have any problems with it, and the whole folding process was more like fun than work. ðŸ˜‰

              In the set, I make every effort even where seemingly they are not required, the ideal example of this are ground edges of, among others, bearing stands or post with M20 thread, it is only a stylistic procedure that does not affect the work of the attachment.

              Thanks to the use of beans for fixing the bearings, we have the possibility of very quick adjustment, and most importantly, infinitely variable. This is especially important when we want to change the size of a pipe or profile frequently.

              Combining the fight with the pinhole was the biggest challenge for me. Initially, I threaded the bar itself, but this connection did not work with larger holesaws. I decided not to balance the open door and used the original adapter to fix the holesaws. It has special pins that absorb all the energy to prevent damage to the thread.
